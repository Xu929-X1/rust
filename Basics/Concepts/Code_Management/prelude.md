# Prelude

As I work as a software engineer, I realize that organizing your code and encapsulating is probably more important in projects. A well designed package can save a lot of effort both in development and maintenance, eventually will lead to more effective workflow.(As long as the requirement is to deliver not to sitting for 8 hours straight)

Rust provides a several code management solutions:

- Packages: A Cargo feature that allow you to build, test, and release crates
- Crates: A tree of modules that produce a library or an executable
- Module and use: Allow you to control the organization, scope and privacy of paths
- Paths: A way of naming an item, such as a ```struct```, function or a module
